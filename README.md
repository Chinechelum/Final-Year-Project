# Final-Year-Project

This is a counselling system on area of specialisation for computer science master's at the University of Nigeria.

I classified the undergraduate computer science courses into the five areas offered:

* Systems Engineering

* Software Engineering

* Artificial Intelligence

* Computer Networks

* Theoretical Computer Science

The software then calculates the average scores of a student, in each group and outputs the largest three averages.
It is a mock artificial intelligence.
